Qt wrapper for BlueZ 5 DBus API, with partial support for BlueZ 4
backends.

The BlueZ 4 support is limited to features provided by the BlueZ 5
API, with some adjustments for the capabilities of BlueZ 5:

- The API remains unchanged. Properties and functions only supported in
  BlueZ 5 return errors or default values. These include:

    - Adapter - modalias (and both alias and systemName refer to the
      'name' property)
    - Device - connectProfile(), disconnectProfile()
    - Manager - registerProfile()
    - MediaPlayer - name, track, and all track control functions
    - MediaTransport - tryAcquire()
    - ObexSession - getCapabilities()
    - ObexTransfer - suspend(), resume()

  Features supported in BlueZ 4 but not 5 are not supported.

- Device::connectToDevice() simply connects to org.bluez.Input or
  org.bluez.Audio depending on the device class.

- MediaTransport uses 'rw' file mode for acquire() and release().

- Per-application agents are not supported. Pairings initiated by
  Device::pair() attempt to reused any system-wide agent that has
  already been registered by the current process through 
  Manager::requestDefaultAgent(). (Any non-OBEX agents is registered
  with an amended object path to enable it to be used as both the 
  system-wide agent and the agent for initiated pairings.)

- OBEX session support is limited. FTP sessions are provided as
  supported by BlueZ 4. For OPP, sessions are created per-transfer, and
  Source, Channel and Target properties are not provided.
